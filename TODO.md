- Fix player name centering on draft page
- Fill DB with draft data
- Provide actual draft data from DB
- Mock draft creation / UI
- User comments (mentions in comments? could mention users, players, teams)
- User profile page (their drafts, comments, etc should be displayed)
- User settings (change password, delete account)
- Account roles (admin vs user)
- Priviledged admin actions (delete other users comments)
All priviledged action endpoints can probably be handled with better auth
